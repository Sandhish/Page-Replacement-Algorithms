# Page Replacement Algorithms Simulator

This project is a web-based simulator for page replacement algorithms implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The simulator demonstrates the workings of three popular page replacement algorithms: Least Recently Used (LRU), First-In-First-Out (FIFO), and Optimal.

## Features

- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Simulates the LRU page replacement algorithm.
- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: Simulates the FIFO page replacement algorithm.
- **Optimal**: Simulates the Optimal page replacement algorithm.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can interact with the simulation to see how different algorithms handle page replacement.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the simulation logic and interactive elements.
